Context --> The purpose of this project is to create datasets consisted of images in a proper state, in order to be used
for training systems such as StyleGAN2, StyleGAN3, etc.

--------- Requirements ---------
a. AFTER ALL THE PREPROCESSING, there will be more images than necessary due to the high frame rate
I should definitely make a frame discarding system. Either by choosing the frames manually, or saving half of the images
in a video, or something
b. Save intro of video only once.

--------- QUESTIONS ---------
1) How should I organize the project?

2) How should I organize the output of a script? (output = A dataset)

3) How should I ogranize the input? Videos in HD, low resolution etc.

---------  ANSWERS  ---------
1) Organize per model and its requirements

2) The output of preprocess is a dataset for a model. Thus we need a package that covers the needs of the models

3) What kind of data do I have? Images and Videos
The videos might need some cropping ==> Cropping should be a standard process into the developed methods with a default
value of 0% cropping.
The videos will be converted to images
All images if low resolution should be furtherly preprocessed into a higher resolution
This raises a new question. What are the thresholds for "super-resolving"?
