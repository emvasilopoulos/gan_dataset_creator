- All data will be read with opencv (cv2).
- Images with opencv are represented as numpy arrays with dims (height_size, widht_size, number_of_channels)
- How to use this tool:
1) Create as many editor.Component objects you want. Each object reflects one effect applied to the input image
2) Create on Editor object. Its constructor need a list of editor.Component objects
3) Create a SeriesHandler object that needs as input:
    a. Directory of series that contains all episodes (video files), that will be processed and saved as individual frames
    b. Directory of frames, where they will be stored
    c. Editor object (optional). If an Editor object is not declared, the images will be saved as is.
